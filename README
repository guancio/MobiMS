MobiMS -- Mobile Mail Server

MobiMS is a mailserver for mobile devices. The main goal of the project
is to allow desktop software to access to your phone SMS/MMS facilities
exploiting standard email protocols (IMAP and SMTP).

MobiMS has been developed to allow managing my phone SMS using "standard"
email clients (not so standard, since I use offlineimap + emace + wanderlust).

MobiMS is simply a prototype, not a full feature IMAP/SMTP server. It
is not really compliant with rfc specifications. Only minimal parts of the
protocols have been implemented, focusing compatibility with specific client.

This prototype have been implemented using python. A future "real" sofware will
be implemented using C++.

Current Status:
* Supported clients
** offlineimap

* Features:
** Download the list and details of all SMS
** Change read status of a SMS

* Planned Features/bugs

** Minimal interface to start and shutdown the server

* Features that will never be implemented using the current architecture
** Support MMS (PyS60 bug https://garage.maemo.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=4197&group_id=854&atid=3201 does not allow do access MMS attachment content)
** Support Folders (PyS60 allow only accessing INBOX folder)
