MobiMS -- Mobile Mail Server

MobiMS is a mailserver for mobile devices. The main goal of the project
is to allow desktop software to access to your phone SMS/MMS facilities
exploiting standard email protocols (IMAP and SMTP).

MobiMS has been developed to allow managing my phone SMS using "standard"
email clients (not so standard, since I use offlineimap + emace + wanderlust).

MobiMS is simply a prototype, not a full feature IMAP/SMTP server. It
is not really compliant with rfc specifications. Only minimal parts of the
protocols have been implemented, focusing compatibility with specific client.

This prototype have been implemented using python. A future "real" sofware will
be implemented using C++.

Current Status:
* Supported clients
** offlineimap
* Supported mobile phones
** Symbian s60 5th edition (N97)
* Email protocols:
** IMAP
* Features:
** Download the list and details of all SMS
** Change read status of a SMS

* Planned Features/bugs
** Support SMTP to send SMS
** Support deletion of messages
** Minimal interface to start and shutdown the server

* Features that will never be implemented using the current architecture
** Support MMS (PyS60 bug https://garage.maemo.org/tracker/index.php?func=detail&aid=4197&group_id=854&atid=3201 does not allow to access MMS attachment content)
** Support Folders (PyS60 allow only accessing INBOX folder)
** Upload message (PyS60 does not provide a suitable API)

Requirements:
Python run-time on your mobile phone
A TCP/Bluetooth proxy (a very dummy proxy is implemented by proxy.py)

Installation:
Copy the phone_imap.py script on your phone python directory (on my N97 it is E:/data/python).

Usage:
Start python interpreter on your phone and run the script.
The script manages only a desktop connection and after the conversation it quits.
You need to manually restart the script to handle a further connection.
User and password are fixed and are guancio/guancio.

Currently MobiMS exploit Bluetooth for desktop/phone communications. Allowing
a standard mail client to connect to your MobiMS requires a proxy that
forwards TCP connections to Bluetooth serial port. A very dummy proxy
is provided by the proxy.py script, that must be executed on your desktop.
